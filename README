#  YNH Server setup with Debian 11 (Bullseye)


# I used Debian 11.6 for this setup. After installing Debian, for some reason sudo was not installed. 
# Created a script that checks and installs sudo on a dnf or apt based system. In this folder there should be a script called 'sudo_error_fix'
# To run the script follow steps below. 




# Copy:

# Copy the script the target machine that does not have sudo installed. You can create a file and paste the content. Or you transferr the file or clone it from github.
# make the script executable.

``` chmod a+x sudo_error_fix ```


Run:

# To run the script, change the current user to root. Then enter the root password. 

# 1. Change user to root
``` su - ```

# 2. Run script

``` ./sudo_error_fix ```

# Once the script is completed then you can perform tasks with sudo.. (Which really doesnt matter after YNH servers gets installed)




# System update:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean -y

# optional 
sudo reboot


# Install the dependencies required by Yunohost:

sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release


# Import Yunohost GPG key:

curl https://install.yunohost.org/public.key | sudo apt-key add -


#  Add the Yunohost repository to the system:

echo "deb https://install.yunohost.org/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yunohost.list


# Update the system with the new repository:

``` sudo apt update ```


# Install Yunohost:

``` sudo apt install yunohost ```


# Follow rest of the install from the browser.
