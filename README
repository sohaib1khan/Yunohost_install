# YNH Server setup with Debian 11 (Bullseye)

# I used Debian 11.6 for this setup. After installing Debian, for some reason, sudo was not installed.

# Created a script that checks and installs sudo on a dnf or apt-based system. In this folder, there should be a script called 'sudo_error_fix'

# To run the script follow the steps below.

# Copy:

# Copy the script to the target machine that does not have sudo installed. You can create a file and paste the content. Or when you run ansible-playbook the script will be transferred into the /tmp directory of the remote machine or clone it from github.... which is the playbook as well :)

# make the script executable.

``` chmod a+x sudo_error_fix ```

# Run:

# To run the script, change the current user to root. Then enter the root password.

# 1. Change user to root

su -

# 2. Run script

./sudo_error_fix

# Once the script is completed then you can perform tasks with sudo.. (Which really doesn't matter after YNH servers get installed)

# System update:

``` sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean -y ```

# optional

``` sudo reboot ```

# Install the dependencies required by Yunohost:

``` sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release ```

# Import Yunohost GPG key:

``` curl https://install.yunohost.org/public.key | sudo apt-key add - ```

# One script install 

``` curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash ```

Follow rest of the install from the browser.

Alternative method:
